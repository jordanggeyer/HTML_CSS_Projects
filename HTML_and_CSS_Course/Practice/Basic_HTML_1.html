	<p><font color="green" face="Arial" size="5">
		<b>St. Patrick's Day</b>, celebrated on <i>March 17th</i>, honors St. Patrick, the patron saint of Ireland. The holiday's origins can be traced back to the early 17th century when it was designated as a feast day by the Catholic Church. St. Patrick is credited with bringing Christianity to Ireland and is known for using the three-leafed shamrock to explain the Holy Trinity. Over time, the holiday evolved from a religious observance to a celebration of Irish culture and heritage, marked by parades, music, dancing, and the wearing of green attire.
